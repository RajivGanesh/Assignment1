                        <p>The system was designed to be readable by any type of device a user chooses to access the platform on. A responsive layout strategy was chosen to move forward in the development of the user interface. This means that an initial layout of the components located on pages were defined, and set to static locations relative to each other. The components on individual pages remain in the same position no matter how the viewport is sized. However, when the page is resized, the components are resized, and rescaled to be viewable at a visible ratio.</p>
                        <p>The system requires no training to use, and was designed to b very simple and intuitive. The designed environment is suitable for the average end-user to have no problem navigating. It has been established that the system has very little downtime outside of weekly maintenance. If an update were to be released for the system, it can be done simultaneously while users are logged in to the application, because of the session state properties which keeps the userâ€™s session state cached on their local storage until they log out or exit the application.</p>
                        <p>Should the system require a critical update that would render some features of the system to be available can be looked at situationally. This is because the system is split up in to many components that render images of themselves when they are called. The components that cannot be used because of an update, can be set to unavailable, while the users continue to work around it in the environment. </p>
